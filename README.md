# QNodeGraph
A graph-based GUI written in Qt.
There are some interesting aspects here that I will describe in a paper that I am in the process of preparing.

# License
This library is licensed under the GPL version 3, a copy of which can be found under [gpl-3.0.txt](gpl-3.0.txt).

# Dependencies
* [Qt](https://www.qt.io/) (licensed under the LGPL version 3 for the parts that I use)
* [KConfigWidgets](https://api.kde.org/frameworks/kconfigwidgets/html/index.html) (which can be licensed under the LGPL version 2.1, if I understand KDEâ€™s policy correctly)

# Building
Building and installing should be trivial with both dependencies present.
